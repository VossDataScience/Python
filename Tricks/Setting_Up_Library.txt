The discovery that a minimal setup.py file is actually pretty easy.

# setup.py
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name='darling',  # So pip knows what it's called
    version='0.1',
    # make sure setup.py's dir contains an importable 'darling':
    # a `darling.py` or a `darling/` dir with an `__init__.py`
    packages=['darling'],
)
When pip-installing my own packages became trivial, that was really nice: suddenly I could have my project in any directory, pip install it, and use it in a project in any other directory. That made splitting functionality into its own package so much easier.
